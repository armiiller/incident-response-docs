The first step in any incident response process is to determine what actually constitutes an incident. Generally this is done by using "SEV" definitions, with lower numbered severities being more urgent. Operational issues can be classified at one of these severity levels, and in general you are able to take more risky moves to resolve a higher severity issue. Anything above a SEV-3 is considered a "major incident" and gets a more intensive response than a normal incident.

!!! note "Always Assume The Worst"
     If you are unsure which level an incident is (e.g. not sure if SEV-2 or SEV-1), **treat it as the higher one**. During an incident is not the time to discuss or litigate severities, just assume the highest and review during a post-mortem.

!!! note "Be Specific"
    These severity descriptions have been changed from the PagerTree internal definitions to be more generic. For your own documentation, you are encouraged to make your definitions very specific, usually referring to a % of users/accounts affected. You will usually want your severity definitions to be metric driven.
